- Add lua using this http://gamedevgeek.com/tutorials/calling-c-functions-from-lua/.<br>
- Add GoLang using cgo (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8231618/how-to-import-a-dll-function-written-in-c-using-go).
- Figure out how to add rust. The issue is that it can only call C.
- Make deleting easier/automatic.
