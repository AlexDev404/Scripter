# Scripter
A dll that allows you to easily mod Fortnite in popular coding languages.<br>
Supports s1-s16 (should work on latest but idk).

# Supported languages

C#, JS, C++

# TODO

- Add checks to make sure the user has the language the script is made in.<br>
- Add lua using this http://gamedevgeek.com/tutorials/calling-c-functions-from-lua/.<br>
- Add GoLang using cgo (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8231618/how-to-import-a-dll-function-written-in-c-using-go).<br>
- Figure out how to add rust. The issue is that it can only call C.<br>
- Make deleting easier/automatic.<br>
- Add authors to script.json<br>
- Add more directory/file checking (if it exists).
- Java support very soon

# FIX SOON
